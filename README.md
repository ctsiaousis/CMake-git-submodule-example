# CMake with git submodules example

In this project I demonstrate the usage of [Eigen Library](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) which is a Linear Algebra module for C++.

The code just parses some CSV files and creates entries.

**Cloning:** you must clone with the `--recurse-submodules` option
